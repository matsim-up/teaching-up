# Production planning and inventory

This problem is taken from Winston (2004), _Introduction to Probability Models_,
Chapter 6, Example 4.

A company knows that the demand for its product during each of the next four 
months will be as follows: month one, 1 unit; month two, 3 units; month three, 
2 units; and month four, 4 units. At the beginning of each month, the company 
must determine how many units should be produced during the current month. 
During a month in which any units are produced, a setup cost of $3 are incurred. 
In addition, there is a variable cost of $1 for every unit produced. At the end 
of each month a holding cost of 50c per unit on hand is incurred. Capacity 
limitations allow a maximum of 5 units to be produced during each month. The 
size of the company's warehouse restricts ending inventory for each month to at 
most 4 units. The company wants to determine a production schedule that will 
meet all demands on time and will minimise the sum of production and holding 
costs during the four months. Assumes that 0 units are on hand at the beginning 
of the first month.

We can define the recursion as

$`f_t(i)\triangleq`$ the minimum costs for months $`t,t+1,...,4`$ given that
there is $`i`$ units in inventory at the start of month $`t`$.

The formulation for $t=T=5$ (the end of month 4) is then simply
```math
f_T(i)\equiv 0.
```
