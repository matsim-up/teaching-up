/**
 * A company knows that the demand for its product during each of the next four
 * months will be as follows: month one, 1 unit; month two, 3 units; month
 * three, 2 units; and month four, 4 units. At the beginning of each month, the
 * company must determine how many units should be produced during the current
 * month. During a month in which any units are produced, a setup cost of $3
 * are incurred. In addition, there is a variable cost of $1 for every unit
 * produced. At the end of each month a holding cost of 50c per unit on hand
 * is incurred. Capacity limitations allow a maximum of 5 units to be produced
 * during each month. The size of the companyâ€™s warehouse restricts ending
 * inventory for each month to at most 4 units. The company wants to determine
 * a production schedule that will meet all demands on time and will minimise
 * the sum of production and holding costs during the four months. Assumes
 * that 0 units are on hand at the beginning of the first month.
